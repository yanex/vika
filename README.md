Vk social network messenger for Blackberry OS 6/7.

For now, Vika features includes:

* Sending and receiving messages from Vk friends and group chats;
* Sending and displaying attachments and forwarded messages;
* New user chats creation;
* Notifications;
* Ability to connect via BIS/WiFi/Cellular.

### TODO

* Refactoring;
* Tests;
* New storage engine;
* Music player (partially done now).

Vika is still in beta so some functions could behave strange.

### Building

Use Eclipse with Blackberry plugin to build the project. Do not forget to write your own keys to `org.yanex.vika.Configuration`.
